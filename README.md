# Installation
To run locally, have Node.js installed on your computer. Then use terminal/command prompt to access the location of the app's files, and enter the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Use Ctrl + C to exit once the app is running.

# Deployment
Should work with any host that supports Node.js. Easiest approach is to create a new repository and link that to a host like Heroku for one-click deployment.
